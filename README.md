Takeaways
Version control with Git is key to staying organized and implementing features separate of one another.
It can be easy to go off track when developing a full-stack application, using a Kanban is another key to success.
When it comes to coding itself, no reason to overcomplicate things right away; write workable code first, and then look to streamline where possible.
